Flask-Paced F1 Racing

Python, JavaScript, React, Flask, SQLite3, SQLAlchemy, CSS

Created a race-fans web application with mock stats to track drivers and races.

Generated back-end with Python and Flask / SQL Alchemy to create databases from the Python models. Front-end built with React.js components and styled with CSS.

"HOME" page is a simple welcome page.

"DRIVERS" page show all drivers and their most basic info. Users have the option to "Ban" a driver, which deletes the driver from the front-end and the back-end database. A form to Add a new driver to the list is at the bottom of the page.

Clicking on a specific driver will take you to that driver's specific link and show more detailed information about the driver.

"RACES" page shows a list of Circuits with their basic information. Similar to the Drivers page, this page has a form to Add a new race/circut to the list. You can also click on a specific track/circut to be taken to that specific circuit link and see more details about that race.

The "STATS" page shows a list of mock stats that show certain drivers' best lap time for a certain Race/Grand Prix. Users also have the ability to add driver stats with a form at the bottom of the page.
